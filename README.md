# UFOs
Module 11

## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this challenge was to create a web application to house data on UFO sightings.  I used an HTML script to set up the webpage design.  This included inserting images, filters with input box, and a table to display the data.  I also utilized a Javascript file to import the data and place it into a table.  This file would also set up how the filters would function when idle and when the user would select the criteria to view.

## Result of Project
### The data housed on the webpage can be filtered using 5 different criteria.  Those filters are date, city, state, country and shape.  The input boxes associated with each filter have placeholders to show examples.

### The user can type their choice in any filter, hit enter and the table will update.  The user can now either input text in another filter to drill down further or clear the filter altogether to reset the table.  The table can be reset in 2 ways: clearing the text from the filter and hit enter or click on the main page title.

## Summary
## Drawback:

### There are a few drawbacks to this webpage.  First, it is case sensitive so if the user does not type in the same case as the data it will not return properly.  Another is the date filter.   The user would have to know an exact date to search in order to return any results.

## Recommendations:

### A function should be added to address case sensitivity.  The code can be altered to look for a match in either upper or lower case, as well as taking spaces at the end of the word into account.

### The date filter should be altered to take in a date range.  This will give the user more freedom to search by month for example.  This can help determine if sightings happen more frequently in certain months.
